																Dynamo action is a mechanism enabling a conducting fluid that harbours 
																three-dimensional and complex enough motions to amplify and self-sustain
																its own magnetic field. The latter generally have feedback reaction on 
																the fluid motions, which makes the study of dynamo very challenging. The diversity
																of processes causing these complex motions differentiate the variety of dynamo 
																mechanisms, which produce the majority of magnetic fields observed in the Universe. 
																My analytical and numerical work focuses one particular dynamo, called the Tayler-Spruit 
																dynamo, which is driven by the combination of large-scale differential rotation and 
																the Tayler instability (instability of a strong large-scale toroidal magnetic field). 
																This mechanism is suspected to produce very efficient angular momentum transport and may
																produce the extreme magnetic fields of magnetars in proto-neutron stars spun up by 
																supernova fallback. Here are some good reviews:

                                                        <h3>Magnetic field stable configuration</h3>
                                                        		<p align="justify">       
                                        				        The magnetic fields observed at the surface of massive stars (spectal types A, B, and O)
																harbour a large-scale geometry (e.g. mostly dipolar configuration) and can reach high 
																intensities (up to a few tens kiloGauss). Recent asteroseismic observations in red giants
																(i.e. evolved low-mass stars) also find very strong radial magnetic fields reaching 
																a few hundreds of kiloGauss. While operating dynamo processes could be a natural 
																explanation of these fields, it is difficult for them to form such strong magnetic 
																fields, especially regarding the slow rotation of these stars. An alternative suggestion 
																is that the fields stem from a past dynamo that operated during the star formation or 
																stellar mergers. Once the dynamo stops operating, the remaining magnetic fields see 
																their geometry reconfigurated to reach a stable configuration (i.e. not prone to any MHD
																instabilities) and finally dissipate at resisitive timescales. This is the so-called 
																fossil field hypothesis and is promising to explain the observations. The research 
																therefore focuses on finding these stable configurations to compare them to observations.
																In the context of magnetar formation, this problem is crucial to test the fossil field 
																and dynamo scenarios as it would bridge the gap between the observation of magnetars, 
																which are already evolved neutron stars, and the proto-neutron star MHD simulations.
																Indeed, understanding these configurations would allow to determine the observable 
																signatures of the different scenarios. I participated, in a collaboration with my 
																PhD team (R. Raynaud, J. Guilet) and a team from Leeds University (A. Igoshev, T. Woods, 
																R. Hollerbach), in the first study investigating this question (accepted in Nature 
																Astronomy).

																known in the Universe, which power a wide variety of high-energy emissions from giant flares 
																to fast radio bursts. The origin of their magnetic field is still a challenging question. 
																As supported by 3D numerical simulations, in situ magnetic field amplification by dynamo action 
																(driven by convection, magnetorotational instability) could potentially generate ultra-strong 
																magnetic fields in fast-rotating progenitors. However, it is unclear whether the fraction of 
																progenitors harbouring fast core rotation is sufficient to explain the entire magnetar population. 
																To address this point, we proposed a new scenario for magnetar formation involving a slowly rotating 
																progenitor, in which a slow-rotating proto-neutron star is spun up by the supernova fallback. 
																We argue that this can trigger the development of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo while other dynamo 
																processes are disfavoured.

                                                                From the observation of solar cycles to the measurements of the magnetic fields at the surface 
																of some stars via the Zeeman effect, it is known that stars harbour magnetic fields from less
																than a few Gauss to a few hundred kiloGauss. Their presence in the stellar interior can influence
																the stellar evolution by influencing the transport of angular momentum and the chemical mixing.
																Recent asteroseismic measurements of (near-)core and surface rotation of some stars have shown 
																that the stellar cores rotate much slower than expected by "non-magnetic" stellar evolution models. 
																Magnetic fields are promising candidates (alongside gravity waves) to explain such discrepancies.
																It is therefore crucial to constrain the physics of magnetic fields in stellar interiors to reproduce 
																the observations and better understand stellar evolution. The Tayler-Spruit dynamo is a promising 
																mechanism to explain the observed efficient transport of angular momentum as it could produce strong 
																enough large-scale magnetic fields. Thus, I am currently investigating further the physics of this dynamo
																process in order to provide better physical constrains for stellar evolution models.
